 Data pagination and filtering

 The application "Data pagination and filtering" generates a webpage of students in card template forms with personal information(first name, last name, email, and a profile picture) and a date of registration. The aim of this project is to showcase pagination and filtering through vanilla javascript. The users are able to navigate through the presentation by the bottom page number buttons and can search for students by typing in letters on the top-left search bar.

 The application consists of two javascripts:
 - data.js, an array with information of 42 students provided by TreeHouse Island Inc.
 - script.js, the vanilla javascript that enhances the usability of webpage with 6 functions, 2 event listeners. Additionally, built-in functions have also been utilized; predominantly the "Element.querySelector()"
